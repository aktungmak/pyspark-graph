## pyspark-graph

This is a pure pyspark implementation of graph algorithms.
Many of these capabilites are already available in GraphX and GraphFrames,
but the language choice limits accessiblity for those who are not 
familiar with Scala.

Additionally, those libraries offer just the basic tools needed to implement
graph analytics whereas here we aim to offer a more batteries-included approach.
